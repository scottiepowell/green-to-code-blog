# Orchestrating FreeIPA User Lifecycles and Group Structures

> Build resilient joiner, mover, and leaver workflows with FreeIPA while keeping POSIX attributes and service credentials tidy.

## Objectives

- Build joiner/mover/leaver workflows using core FreeIPA features.
- Use staged users and preserved users for clean HR flows.
- Manage POSIX attributes (UID/GID/home/shell) and nested groups for consistent access.
- Create service accounts safely, favoring keytabs and non-interactive shells.

## Lab Setup

- Staged user placeholder: `sara.smith` (future developer).
- Groups and nesting: `dev`, `ops`, `dev-backend` (nested inside `dev`).
- IPA administrators with rights to manage staged users, groups, HBAC, and sudo policies.

Document the baseline state before changes—`ipa user-find`, `ipa group-show dev`, and current HBAC/sudo rules—so you can demonstrate how access evolves.

## Build the Lifecycle Playbook

### Stage and Activate a Joiner

Create the user in the staging area with the attributes HR supplies. Staged entries keep data ready without allowing logins until activation.

```bash
ipa stageuser-add sara.smith --first=Sara --last=Smith --email=sara.smith@roadmaps.link --setattr=loginShell=/bin/bash
ipa stageuser-activate sara.smith
ipa user-mod sara.smith --shell=/bin/bash --homedir=/home/sara
ipa group-add-member dev --users=sara.smith
```

Capture the auto-assigned UID/GID after activation with `ipa user-show sara.smith`. If you need a deterministic identifier, re-run the modification with `--uid=<number>` before the account sees any activity.

### Manage Nested Groups and Roles

Use nested groups to model functional teams. Membership in `dev-backend` should automatically grant `dev` access, so keep the hierarchy clear.

```bash
ipa group-add dev-backend --desc="Backend developers"
ipa group-add-member dev --groups=dev-backend
```

Add users directly to `dev-backend` to inherit `dev` privileges. Validate access with `hbactest` or by running `sudo -l` on a policy-controlled host to prove the nested membership works end-to-end.

### Handle Movers

When Sara transfers from backend development to operations, update her membership and immediately confirm the policy shift.

```bash
ipa group-remove-member dev-backend --users=sara.smith
ipa group-add-member ops --users=sara.smith
```

SSSD refreshes group data quickly, but force an update with `sss_cache -E` or `id sara.smith` on clients if needed. Demonstrate the change with before-and-after `hbactest` or `sudo -l` results tied to her new role.

### Preserve or Remove Leavers

Disable accounts promptly to block authentication while retaining an audit trail.

```bash
ipa user-disable sara.smith
ipa user-del --preserve sara.smith
```

The preserved entry stores historical attributes for compliance. Restore it with `ipa user-undel <DN>` when the user returns. If policy demands full deletion, run `ipa user-del sara.smith` instead—document who authorized the irreversible removal.

### Safeguard Service Accounts

Avoid using human-style accounts for automation whenever possible.

#### Pattern A: Minimal User Entry

```bash
ipa user-add svc-ci --desc="CI service" --shell=/sbin/nologin
ipa user-mod svc-ci --random
ipa user-mod svc-ci --setattr=nsAccountLock=TRUE
```

This approach works for rare LDAP binds but keep the password in a vault and disable interactive logins.

#### Pattern B: Kerberos Principals with Keytabs (Preferred)

```bash
ipa service-add HTTP/app01.roadmaps.link
ipa-getkeytab -s ipa1.roadmaps.link -p HTTP/app01.roadmaps.link -k /etc/httpd/httpd.keytab
chmod 600 /etc/httpd/httpd.keytab
```

Rotate keytabs on a schedule and store them with the same rigor you apply to TLS private keys. Reference your Kerberos, SPNEGO, or reverse proxy deployment guides so operators know where these credentials plug in.

## Verification Checklist

- New user logins succeed once activated, showing the correct shell, home directory, and UID/GID via `id` and `getent passwd`.
- Group-based access updates reflect in real time—compare `sudo -l` before and after moving Sara between teams.
- Restoring a preserved user with `ipa user-undel` returns the UID, groups, and SSH keys you expect.

## Pitfalls and Planning Tips

- **UID/GID collisions** – When migrating from legacy directories, map existing identifiers and reserve ranges in FreeIPA to avoid overlaps.
- **Group sprawl** – Keep nesting shallow and document which HBAC or sudo rules rely on each group so movers do not inherit lingering rights.
- **Service account hygiene** – Favor Kerberos principals with keytabs. If you must provision user-style accounts, keep shells locked down and rotate credentials automatically.
